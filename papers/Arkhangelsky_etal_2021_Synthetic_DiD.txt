Abstract
We present a new estimator for causal effects with panel data that builds on insights
behind the widely used difference in differences and synthetic control methods. Relative to
these methods we find, both theoretically and empirically, that this “synthetic difference
in differences” estimator has desirable robustness properties, and that it performs well
in settings where the conventional estimators are commonly used in practice. We study
the asymptotic behavior of the estimator when the systematic part of the outcome model
includes latent unit factors interacted with latent time factors, and we present conditions
for consistency and asymptotic normality.

Introduction

Researchers are often interested in evaluating the effects of policy changes using panel data,
i.e., using repeated observations of units across time, in a setting where some units are exposed
to the policy in some time periods but not others. These policy changes are frequently not
random—neither across units of analysis, nor across time periods—and even unconfoundedness
given observed covariates may not be credible (e.g., Imbens and Rubin [2015]). In the absence
of exogenous variation researchers have focused on statistical models that connect observed data
to unobserved counterfactuals. Many approaches have been developed for this setting but, in
practice, a handful of methods are dominant in empirical work. As documented by Currie,
Kleven, and Zwiers [2020], Difference in Differences (DID) methods have been widely used in
applied economics over the last three decades; see also Ashenfelter and Card [1985], Bertrand,
Duflo, and Mullainathan [2004], and Angrist and Pischke [2008]. More recently, Synthetic
Control (SC) methods, introduced in a series of seminal papers by Abadie and coauthors [Abadie
and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2010, 2015, Abadie and L’Hour,
2016], have emerged as an important alternative method for comparative case studies.
Currently these two strategies are often viewed as targeting different types of empirical
applications. In general, DID methods are applied in cases where we have a substantial number
of units that are exposed to the policy, and researchers are willing to make a “parallel trends”
assumption which implies that we can adequately control for selection effects by accounting for
additive unit-specific and time-specific fixed effects. In contrast, SC methods, introduced in a
setting with only a single (or small number) of units exposed, seek to compensate for the lack
of parallel trends by re-weighting units to match their pre-exposure trends.
In this paper, we argue that although the empirical settings where DID and SC methods
are typically used differ, the fundamental assumptions that justify both methods are closely
related. We then propose a new method, Synthetic Difference in Differences (SDID), that
combines attractive features of both. Like SC, our method re-weights and matches pre-exposure
trends to weaken the reliance on parallel trend type assumptions. Like DID, our method is
invariant to additive unit-level shifts, and allows for valid large-panel inference. Theoretically,
we establish consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Empirically, we find that
our method is competitive with (or dominates) DID in applications where DID methods have
been used in the past, and likewise is competitive with (or dominates) SC in applications where
2

SC methods have been used in the past.
To introduce the basic ideas, consider a balanced panel with N units and T time periods,
where the outcome for unit i in period t is denoted by Yit , and exposure to the binary treatment
is denoted by Wit ∈ {0, 1}. Suppose moreover that the first Nco (control) units are never exposed
to the treatment, while the last Ntr = N − Nco (treated) units are exposed after time Tpre .1 Like
with SC methods, we start by finding weights ω̂ sdid that align pre-exposure trends in the outcome
P
P co sdid
Yit ≈ Ntr−1 N
of unexposed units with those for the exposed units, e.g., N
i=Nco +1 Yit for
i=1 ω̂i
all t = 1, . . . , Tpre . We also look for time weights λ̂sdid
that balance pre-exposure time periods
t
with post-exposure ones (see Section 2 for details). Then we use these weights in a basic two-way
fixed effects regression to estimate the average causal effect of exposure (denoted by τ ):2

In comparison, DID estimates the effect of treatment exposure by solving the same two-way
fixed effects regression problem without either time or unit weights:

The use of weights in the SDID estimator effectively makes the two-way fixed effect regression
“local,” in that it emphasizes (puts more weight on) units that on average are similar in terms
of their past to the target (treated) units, and it emphasizes periods that are on average similar
to the target (treated) periods.
This localization can bring two benefits relative to the standard DID estimator. Intuitively,
using only similar units and similar periods makes the estimator more robust. For example,
if one is interested in estimating the effect of anti-smoking legislation on California (Abadie,
Diamond, and Hainmueller [2010]), or the effect of German reunification on West Germany
(Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller [2015]), or the effect of the Mariel boatlift on Miami (Card
1

Throughout the main part of our analysis, we focus on the block treatment assignment case where Wit =
1 ({i > Nco , t > Tpre }). In the closely related staggered adoption case (Athey and Imbens [2021]) where units
adopt the treatment at different times, but remain exposed after they first adopt the treatment, one can modify
the methods developed here. See Section 8 in the Appendix for details.
2
This estimator also has an interpretation as a difference-in-differences of weighted averages of observations.
See Equations 2.4- 2.5 below.

3

[1990], Peri and Yasenov [2019]), it is natural to emphasize states, countries or cities that are
similar to California, West Germany, or Miami respectively relative to states, countries or cities
that are not. Perhaps less intuitively, the use of the weights can also improve the estimator’s
precision by implicitly removing systematic (predictable) parts of the outcome. However, the
latter is not guaranteed: If there is little systematic heterogeneity in outcomes by either units
or time periods, the unequal weighting of units and time periods may worsen the precision of
the estimators relative to the DID estimator.
Unit weights are designed so that the average outcome for the treated units is approximately
parallel to the weighted average for control units. Time weights are designed so that the average
post-treatment outcome for each of the control units differs by a constant from the weighted
average of the pre-treatment outcomes for the same control units. Together, these weights
make the DID strategy more plausible. This idea is not far from the current empirical practice.
Raw data rarely exhibits parallel time trends for treated and control units, and researchers use
different techniques, such as adjusting for covariates or selecting appropriate time periods to
address this problem (e.g., Abadie [2005], Callaway and Sant’anna [2020]). Graphical evidence
that is used to support the parallel trends assumption is then based on the adjusted data.
SDID makes this process automatic and applies a similar logic to weighting both units and
time periods, all while retaining statistical guarantees. From this point of view, SDID addresses
pretesting concerns recently expressed in Roth [2018].
In comparison with the SDID estimator, the SC estimator omits the unit fixed effect and
the time weights from the regression function:

The argument for including time weights in the SDID estimator is the same as the argument for
including the unit weights presented earlier: The time weight can both remove bias and improve
precision by eliminating the role of time periods that are very different from the post-treatment
periods. Similar to the argument for the use of weights, the argument for the inclusion of
the unit fixed effects is twofold. First, by making the model more flexible, we strengthen its
robustness properties. Second, as demonstrated in the application and simulations based on real
data, these unit fixed effects often explain much of the variation in outcomes and can improve

4

precision. Under some conditions, SC weighting can account for the unit fixed effects on its
own. In particular, this happens when the weighted average of the outcomes for the control
units in the pre-treatment periods is exactly equal to the average of outcomes for the treated
units during those pre-treatment periods. In practice, this equality holds only approximately,
in which case including the unit fixed effects in the weighted regression will remove some of the
remaining bias. The benefits of including unit fixed effects in the SC regression (1.3) can also
be obtained by applying the synthetic control method after centering the data by subtracting,
from each unit’s trajectory, its pre-treatment mean. This estimator was previously suggested in
Doudchenko and Imbens [2016] and Ferman and Pinto [2019]. To separate out the benefits of
allowing for fixed effects from those stemming from the use of time-weights, we include in our
application and simulations this DIFP estimator.

2

An Application

To get a better understanding of how τ̂ did , τ̂ sc and τ̂ sdid compare to each other, we first revisit
the California smoking cessation program example of Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller [2010].
The goal of their analysis was to estimate the effect of increased cigarette taxes on smoking in
California. We consider observations for 39 states (including California) from 1970 through
2000. California passed Proposition 99 increasing cigarette taxes (i.e., is treated) from 1989
onwards. Thus, we have Tpre = 19 pre-treatment periods, Tpost = T − Tpre = 12 post-treatment
periods, Nco = 38 unexposed states, and Ntr = 1 exposed state (California).

2.1

Implementing SDID

Before presenting results on the California smoking case, we discuss in detail how we choose
the synthetic control type weights ω̂ sdid and λ̂sdid used for our estimator as specified in (1.1).
Recall that, at a high level, we want to choose the unit weights to roughly match pre-treatment
P co sdid
P
trends of unexposed units with those for the exposed ones, N
Yit ≈ Ntr−1 N
i=1 ω̂i
i=Nco +1 Yit
for all t = 1, . . . , Tpre , and similarly we want to choose the time weights to balance pre- and
post-exposure periods for unexposed units.
In the case of the unit weights ω̂ sdid , we implement this by solving the optimization problem

That is, we choose the regularization parameter ζ to match the size of a typical one-period outcome change ∆it for unexposed units in the pre-period, multiplied by a theoretically motivated
scaling (Ntr Tpost )1/4 . The SDID weights ω̂ sdid are closely related to the weights used in Abadie,
Diamond, and Hainmueller [2010], with two minor differences. First, we allow for an intercept
term ω0 , meaning that the weights ω̂ sdid no longer need to make the unexposed pre-trends perfectly match the exposed ones; rather, it is sufficient that the weights make the trends parallel.
The reason we can allow for this extra flexibility in the choice of weights is that our use of
fixed effects αi will absorb any constant differences between different units. Second, following
Doudchenko and Imbens [2016], we add a regularization penalty to increase the dispersion, and
ensure the uniqueness, of the weights. If we were to omit the intercept ω0 and set ζ = 0, then
(2.1) would correspond exactly to a choice of weights discussed in Abadie et al. [2010] in the
case where Ntr = 1.

The main difference between (2.1) and (2.3) is that we use regularization for the former but
not the latter. This choice is motivated by our formal results, and reflects the fact we allow
for correlated observations within time periods for the same unit, but not across units within a
time period, beyond what is captured by the systematic component of outcomes as represented
by a latent factor model.
We summarize our procedure as Algorithm 1.4 In our application and simulations we also
report the SC and DIFP estimators. Both of these use weights solving (2.1) without regularization. The SC estimator also omits the intercept ω0 .5 Finally, we report results for the matrix
3

The weights λ̂sdid may not be uniquely defined, as `time can have multiple minima. In principle our results
hold for any argmin of `time . These tend to be similar in the setting we consider, as they all converge to unique
‘oracle weights’ λ̃sdid that are discussed in Section 4.2. In practice, to make the minimum defining our time
weights unique, we add a very small regularization term ζ 2 Nco kλk2 to `time , taking ζ = 10−6 σ̂ for σ̂ as in (2.2).

Some applications feature time-varying exogenous covariates Xit ∈ Rp . We can incorporate adjustment for
these covariates by applying SDID to the residuals Yitres = Yit − Xit β̂ of the regression of Yit on Xit .
5
Like the time weights λ̂sdid , the unit weights for the SC and DIFP estimators may not be uniquely defined.
To ensure uniqueness in practice, we take ζ = 10−6 σ̂, not ζ = 0, in `unit . In our simulations, SC and DIFP with

missing Yit (0) using a low rank factor model with nuclear norm regularization.

2.2

The California Smoking Cessation Program

The results from running this analysis are shown in Table 1. As argued in Abadie et al. [2010],
the assumptions underlying the DID estimator are suspect here, and the -27.3 point estimate
likely overstates the effect of the policy change on smoking. SC provides a reduced (and generally
considered more credible) estimate of -19.6. The other methods, our proposed SDID, the DIFP
and the MC estimator are all smaller than the DID estimator with the SDID and DIFP estimator
substantially smaller than the SC estimator. At the very least, this difference in point estimates
implies that the use of time weights and unit fixed effects in (1.1) materially affects conclusions;
and, throughout this paper, we will argue that when τ̂ sc and τ̂ sdid differ, the latter is often more
credible. Next, and perhaps surprisingly, we see that the standard errors obtained for SDID
(and also for SCIFP, and MC) are smaller than those for DID, despite our method being more
flexible. This is a result of the local fit of SDID (and SC) being improved by the weighting.
To facilitate direct comparisons, we observe that each of the three estimators can be rewritten
as a weighted average difference in adjusted outcomes δ̂i for appropriate sample weights ω̂i :

The top panel of Figure 1 illustrates how each method operates. As is well known [Ashenfelter and Card, 1985], DID relies on the assumption that cigarette sales in different states
would have evolved in a parallel way absent the intervention. Here, pre-intervention trends are
obviously not parallel, so the DID estimate should be considered suspect. In contrast, SC reweights the unexposed states so that the weighted of outcomes for these states match California
pre-intervention as close as possible, and then attributes any post-intervention divergence of
California from this weighted average to the intervention. What SDID does here is to re-weight
the unexposed control units to make their time trend parallel (but not necessarily identical) to
California pre-intervention, and then applies a DID analysis to this re-weighted panel. Moreover, because of the time weights, we only focus on a subset of the pre-intervention time periods
when carrying out this last step. These time periods were selected so that the weighted average
of historical outcomes predict average treatment period outcomes for control units, up to a constant. It is useful to contrast the data-driven SDID approach to selecting the time weights to
both DID, where all pre-treatment periods are given equal weight, and to event studies where
typically the last pre-treatment period is used as a comparison and so implicitly gets all the
weight (e.g., Borusyak and Jaravel [2016], Freyaldenhoven et al. [2019]).
The lower panel of Figure 1 plots δ̂tr − δ̂i for each method and for each unexposed state, where
the size of each point corresponds to its weight ω̂i ; observations with zero weight are denoted by
an ×-symbol. As discussed in Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller [2010], the SC weights ω̂ sc are
sparse. The SDID weights ω̂ sdid are also sparse—but less so. This is due to regularization and the
use of the intercept ω0 , which allows greater flexibility in solving (2.1), enabling more balanced

with large absolute values of ω̂i (δ̂tr − δ̂i ) (e.g., in both cases, New Hampshire). In contrast,
SDID does not give any state particularly high influence, suggesting that after weighting, we
have achieved the desired “parallel trends” as illustrated in the top panel of Figure 1 without
inducing excessive variance in the estimator by using concentrated weights.

Placebo Studies

So far, we have relied on conceptual arguments to make the claim that SDID inherits good
robustness properties from both traditional DID and SC methods, and shows promise as a
method that can be used is settings where either DID and SC would traditionally be used. The
goal of this section is to see how these claims play out in realistic empirical settings. To this
end, we consider two carefully crafted simulation studies, calibrated to datasets representative
of those typically used for panel data studies. The first simulation study mimics settings where
DID would be used in practice (Section 3.1), while the second mimics settings suited to SC
(Section 3.2). Not only do we base the outcome model of our simulation study on real datasets,
we further ensure that the treatment assignment process is realistic by seeking to emulate the
distribution of real policy initiatives. To be specific, in Section 3.1, we consider a panel of US
states. We estimate several alternative treatment assignment models to create the hypothetical
treatments, where the models are based on the state laws related to minimum wages, abortion
or gun rights.
In order to run such a simulation study, we first need to commit to an econometric specification that can be used to assess the accuracy of each method. Here, we work with the following
latent factor model (also referred to as an “interactive fixed-effects model”, Xu [2017], see also
Athey et al. [2017]),
Yit = γi υt> + τ Wit + εit ,

(3.1)

where γi is a vector of latent unit factors of dimension R, and υt is a vector of latent time factors
of dimension R. In matrix form, this can be written
Y = L + τW + E

where

L = ΓΥ> .
11

(3.2)

We refer to E as the idiosyncratic component or error matrix, and to L as the systematic component. We assume that the conditional expectation of the error matrix E given the assignment
matrix W and the systematic component L is zero. That is, the treatment assignment cannot
depend on E. However, the treatment assignment may in general depend on the systematic
component L (i.e., we do not take W to be randomized). We assume that Ei is independent
of Ei0 for each pair of units i, i0 , but we allow for correlation across time periods within a unit.
Our goal is to estimate the treatment effect τ .
The model (3.2) captures several qualitative challenges that have received considerable attention in the recent panel data literature. When the matrix L takes on an additive form, i.e.,
Lit = αi + βt , then the DID regression will consistently recover τ . Allowing for interactions in
L is a natural way to generalize the fixed-effects specification and discuss inference in settings
where DID is misspecified [Bai, 2009, Moon and Weidner, 2015, 2017]. In our formal results
given in Section 4, we show how, despite not explicitly fitting the model (3.2), SDID can consistently estimate τ in this design under reasonable conditions. Finally, accounting for correlation
over time within observations of the same unit is widely considered to be an important ingredient to credible inference using panel data [Angrist and Pischke, 2008, Bertrand, Duflo, and
Mullainathan, 2004].
In our experiments, we compare DID, SC, SDID, and DIFP, all implemented exactly as in
Section 2. We also compare these four estimators to an alternative that estimates τ by directly
fitting both L and τ in (3.2); specifically, we consider the matrix completion (MC) estimator
recommended in Athey, Bayati, Doudchenko, Imbens, and Khosravi [2017] which uses nuclear
norm penalization to regularize its estimate of L. In the remainder of this section, we focus on
comparing the bias and root-mean-squared error of the estimator. We discuss questions around
inference and coverage in Section 5.

3.1

Current Population Survey Placebo Study

Our first set of simulation experiments revisits the landmark placebo study of Bertrand, Duflo,
and Mullainathan [2004] using the Current Population Survey (CPS). The main goal of Bertrand
et al. [2004] was to study the behavior of different standard error estimators for DID. To do
so, they randomly assigned a subset of states in the CPS dataset to a placebo treatment and
the rest to the control group, and examined how well different approaches to inference for DID
12

estimators covered the true treatment effect of zero. Their main finding was that only methods
that were robust to serial correlation of repeated observations for a given unit (e.g., methods
that clustered observations by unit) attained valid coverage.
We modify the placebo analyses in Bertrand et al. [2004] in two ways. First, we no longer
assigned exposed states completely at random, and instead use a non-uniform assignment mechanism that is inspired by different policy choices actually made by different states. Using a
non-uniformly random assignment is important because it allows us to differentiate between
various estimators in ways that completely random assignment would not. Under completely
random assignment, a number of methods, including DID, perform well because the presence
of L in (3.2) introduces zero bias. In contrast, with a non-uniform random assignment (i.e.,
treatment assignment is correlated with systematic effects), methods that do not account for
the presence of L will be biased. Second, we simulate values for the outcomes based on a model
estimated on the CPS data, in order to have more control over the data generating process.
3.1.1

The Data Generating Process

For the first set of simulations we use as the starting point data on wages for women with
positive wages in the March outgoing rotation groups in the Current Population Survey (CPS)
for the years 1979 to 2019. We first transform these by taking logarithms and then average
them by state/year cells. Our simulation design has two components, an outcome model and an
assignment model. We generate outcomes via a simulation that seeks to capture the behavior
of the average by state/year of the logarithm of wages for those with positive hours worked in
the CPS data as in Bertrand et al. [2004]. Specifically, we simulate data using the model (3.2),
where the rows Ei of E have a multivariate Gaussian distribution Ei ∼ N (0, Σ), and we choose
both L and Σ to fit the CPS data as follows. First, we fit a rank four factor model for L:
L := arg min

X

(Yit∗ − Lit )2 ,

(3.3)

L:rank(L)=4 it

where Yit∗ denotes the true state/year average of log-wage in the CPS data. We then estimate
Σ by fitting an AR(2) model to the residuals of Yit∗ − Lit . For purpose of interpretation, we
further decompose the systematic component L into an additive (fixed effects) term F and an

13

interactive term M , with

Fit = αi + βt =
Ljt −
Lit ,

T l=1
N j=1
N T it

(3.4)

Mit = Lit − Fit .
This decomposition of L into an additive two-way fixed effect component F and an interactive
component M enables us to study the sensitivity of different estimators to the presence of
different types of systematic effects.
Next we discuss generation of the treatment assignment. Here, we are designing a “null
effect” study, meaning that treatment has no effect on the outcomes and all methods should
estimate zero. However, to make this more challenging, we choose the treated units so that the
assignment mechanism is correlated with the systematic component L. We set Wit = Di 1t>T0 ,
where Di is a binary exposure indicator generated as
Di Ei , αi , Mi ∼ Bernoulli (πi ) ,

πi = π(αi , Mi ; φ) =

exp(φα αi + φM Mi )
.
1 + exp(φα αi + φM Mi )

(3.5)

In particular, the distribution of Di may depend on αi and Mi ; however, Di is independent of
Ei , i.e., the assignment is strictly exogenous.6 To construct probabilities {πi } for this assignment model, we choose φ as the coefficient estimates from a logistic regression of an observed
binary characteristic of the state Di on Mi and αi . We consider three different choices for
Di , relating to minimum wage laws, abortion rights, and gun control laws.7 As a result, we
get assignment probability models that reflect actual differences across states with respect to
important economic variables. In practice the αi and Mi that we construct predict a sizable
part of variation in Di , with R2 varying from 15% to 30%.
3.1.2

Simulation Results

Table 2 compares the performance of the four aforementioned estimators in the simulation
design described above. We consider various choices for the number of treated units and the
6

In the simulations below, we restrict the maximal number of treated units (either to 10 or 1). To achieve this,
we first sample Di independently and accept the results if the number of treated units satisfies the constraint.
If it does not, then we choose the maximal allowed number of treated units from those selected in the first step
uniformly at random.

Table 2: Simulation Results for CPS Data. The baseline case uses state minimum wage
laws to simulate treatment assignment, and generates outcomes using the full data-generating
process described in Section 3.1.1, with Tpost = 10 post-treatment periods and at most Ntr = 10
treatment states. In subsequent settings, we omit parts of the data-generating process (rows
2-6), consider different distributions for the treatment exposure variable Di (rows 7-9), different
distributions for the outcome variable (rows 10-11), and vary the number of treated cells (rows
12-14). The full dataset has N = 50, T = 40, and outcomes are normalized to have mean zero
and unit variance. All results are based on 1000 simulation replications.

treatment assignment distribution. Furthermore, we also consider settings where we drop various
components of the outcome-generating process, such as the fixed effects F or the interactive
component M , or set the noise correlation matrix Σ to be diagonal. The magnitude of the F ,
M and E components as well as the strength of the autocorrelation effects in Σ captured by
the first two autoregressive coefficients are shown in the first four columns of Table 2.
At a high level, we find that SDID has excellent performance relative to the benchmarks
—both in terms of bias and root-mean squared error. This holds in the baseline simulation
design and over a number of other designs where we vary the treatment assignment (from being
based on minimum wage laws to gun laws, abortion laws, or completely random), the outcome
(from average of log wages to average hours and unemployment rate), and the maximal number
of treated units (from 10 to 1) and the number of exposed periods (from 10 to 1). We find that
when the treatment assignment is uniformly random, all methods are essentially unbiased, but
SDID is more precise. Meanwhile, when the treatment assignment is not uniformly random,

Figure 2: Distribution of the errors of SDID, SC and DID in the setting of the “baseline” (i.e.,
with minimum wage) and random assignment rows of Table 2.

SDID is particularly successful at mitigating bias while keeping variance in check.
In the second panel of Table 2 we provide some additional insights into the superior performance of the SDID estimator by sequentially dropping some of the components of the model that
generates the potential outcomes. If we drop the interactive component M from the outcome
model (“No M ”), so that the fixed effect specification is correct, the DID estimator performs
best (alongside MC). In contrast, if we drop the fixed effects component (“No F ”) but keep
the interactive component, the SC estimator does best. If we drop both parts of the systematic
component, and there is only noise, the superiority of the SDID estimator vanishes and all estimators are essentially equivalent. On the other hand, if we remove the noise component so that
there is only signal, the increased flexibility of the SDID estimator allows it (alongside MC) to
outperform the SC and DID estimators dramatically.
Next, we focus on two designs of interest: One with the assignment probability model based
on parameters estimated in the minimum wage law model and one where the treatment exposure
Di is assigned uniformly at random. Figure 2 shows the errors of the DID, SC and SDID
estimators in both settings, and reinforces our observations above. When assignment is not
uniformly random, the distribution of the DID errors is visibly off-center, showing the bias
of the estimator. In contrast, the errors from SDID are nearly centered. Meanwhile, when
treatment assignment is uniformly random, both estimators are centered but the errors of DID
are more spread out. We note that the right panel of Figure 2 is closely related to the simulation

16

specification of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan [2004]. From this perspective, Bertrand et al.
[2004] correctly argue that the error distribution of DID is centered, and that the error scale
can accurately be recovered using appropriate robust estimators. Here, however, we go further
and show that this noise can be substantially reduced by using an estimator like SDID that can
exploit predictable variation by matching on pre-exposure trends.
Finally, we note that Figure 2 shows that the error distribution of SDID is nearly unbiased
and Gaussian in both designs, thus suggesting that it should be possible to use τ̂ sdid as the basis
for valid inference. We postpone a discussion of confidence intervals until Section 5, where we
consider various strategies for inference based on SDID and show that they attain good coverage
here.

3.2

Penn World Table Placebo Study

The simulation based on the CPS is a natural benchmark for applications that traditionally
rely on DID-type methods to estimate the policy effects. In contrast, SC methods are often
used in applications where units tend to be more heterogeneous and are observed over a longer
timespan as in, e.g., Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller [2015]. To investigate the behavior
of SDID in this type of setting, we propose a second set of simulations based on the Penn
World Table. This dataset contains observations on annual real GDP for N = 111 countries for
T = 48 consecutive years, starting from 1959; we end the dataset in 2007 because we do not
want the treatment period to coincide with the Great Recession. We construct the outcome
and the assignment model following the same procedure outlined in the previous subsection.
We select log(real GDP) as the primary outcome. As with the CPS dataset, the two-way fixed
effects explain most of the variation; however, the interactive component plays a larger role
in determining outcomes for this dataset than for the CPS data. We again derive treatment
assignment via an exposure variable Di , and consider both a uniformly random distribution
for Di as well as two non-uniform ones based on predicting Penn World Table indicators of
democracy and education respectively.
Results of the simulation study are presented in Table 3. At a high level, these results mirror
the ones above: SDID again performs well in terms of both bias and root-mean squared error
and across all simulation settings dominates the other estimators. In particular, SDID is nearly
unbiased, which is important for constructing confidence intervals with accurate coverage rates.

the outcome, with Ntr = 10 out of N = 111 treatment countries, and Tpost = 10 out of T = 48
treatment periods. In the first two rows we consider treatment assignment distributions based
on democracy status and education metrics, while in the last row the treatment is assigned
completely at random. All results are based on 1000 simulations.

The main difference between Tables 2 and 3 is that DID does substantially worse here relative
to SC than before. This appears to be due to the presence of a stronger interactive component
in the Penn World Table dataset, and is in line with the empirical practice of preferring SC over
DID in settings of this type. We again defer a discussion of inference to Section 5.

Formal Results

In this section we discuss the formal results. For the remainder of the paper, we assume that
the data generating process follows a generalization of the latent factor model (3.2),
Y = L + W ◦ τ + E,

where

(W ◦ τ )it = Wit τit .

(4.1)

The model allows for heterogeneity in treatment effects τit , as in de Chaisemartin and d’Haultfœuille
[2020]. As above, we assume block assignment Wit = 1 ({i > Nco , t > Tpre }), where the subscript
“co” stands for control group, “tr” stands for treatment group, “pre” stands for pre-treatment,
and “post” stands for post-treatment. It is useful to characterize the systematic component L
as a factor model L = ΓΥ> as in (3.2), where we define factors Γ = U D 1/2 and Υ> = D 1/2 V >
in terms of the singular value decomposition L = U DV > . Our target estimand is the average
treatment effect for the treated units during the periods they were treated, which under block
assignment is

with Yco,pre a Nco × Tpre matrix, Yco,post a Nco × Tpost matrix, Ytr,pre a Ntr × Tpre matrix, and
Ytr,post a Ntr × Tpost matrix, and similar for L, W , τ , and E. Throughout our analysis, we
will assume that the errors Ei. are homoskedastic across units (but not across time), i.e., that
Var [Ei. ] = Σ ∈ RT ×T for all units i = 1, . . . , n. We partition Σ as

Σ=

.

Given this setting, we are interested in guarantees on how accurately SDID can recover τ .
A simple, intuitively appealing approach to estimating τ in (4.1) is to directly fit both L
and τ via methods for low-rank matrix estimation, and several variants of this approach have
been proposed in the literature [e.g., Athey, Bayati, Doudchenko, Imbens, and Khosravi, 2017,
Bai, 2009, Xu, 2017, Agarwal, Shah, Shen, and Song, 2019]. However, our main interest is in τ
and not in L, and so one might suspect that approaches that provide consistent estimation of
L may rely on assumptions that are stronger than what is necessary for consistent estimation
of τ .
Synthetic control methods address confounding bias without explicitly estimatin L in (4.1).
Instead, they take an indirect approach more akin to balancing as in Zubizarreta [2015] and
Athey, Imbens, and Wager [2018]. Recall that the SC weights ω̂ sc seek to balance out the
pre-intervention trends in Y . Qualitatively, one might hope that doing so also leads us to
P

balance out the unit-factors Γ from (3.2), rendering N

i=1 ω̂i Γi. ≈ 0. Abadie,
Diamond, and Hainmueller [2010] provide some arguments for why this should be the case, and
our formal analysis outlines a further set of conditions under which this type of phenomenon
holds. Then, if ω̂ sc in fact succeeds in balancing out the factors in Γ, the SC estimator can

i=1 (2Wi − 1)ω̂i ε̄i with ε̄i = Tpost
t=Tpre +1 εit ; in words, SC
weighting has succeeded in removing the bias associated with the systematic component L and
in delivering a nearly unbiased estimate of τ .
Much like the SC estimator, the SDID estimator seeks to recover τ in (4.1) by reweighting
to remove the bias associated with L. However, the SDID estimator takes a two–pronged
19

approach. First, instead of only making use of unit weights ω̂ that can be used to balance out
Γ, the estimator also incorporates time weights λ̂ that seek to balance out Υ. This provides a
type of double robustness property, whereby if one of the balancing approaches is effective, the
dependence on L is approximately removed. Second, the use of two-way fixed effects in (1.1)
and intercept terms in (2.1) and (2.3) makes the SDID estimator invariant to additive shocks to
any row or column, i.e., if we modify Lit ← Lit + αi + βt for any choices αi and βt the estimator
τ̂ sdid remains unchanged. The estimator shares this invariance property with DID (but not SC).8
The goal of our formal analysis is to understand how and when the SDID weights succeed
in removing the bias due to L. As discussed below, this requires assumptions on the signal to
noise ratio. The assumptions require that E does not incorporate too much serial correlation
within units, so that we can attribute persistent patterns in Y to patterns in L; furthermore, Γ
should be stable over time, particularly through the treatment periods. Of course, these are nontrivial assumptions. However, as discussed further in Section 6, they are considerably weaker
than what is required in results of Bai [2009] or Moon and Weidner [2015, 2017] for methods
that require explicitly estimating L in (4.1). Furthermore, these assumption are aligned with
standard practice in the literature; for example, we can assess the claim that we balance all
components of Γ by examining the extent to which the method succeeds in balancing preintervention periods. Historical context may be needed to justify the assumption that that
there were no other shocks disproportionately affecting the treatment units at the time of the
treatment.

4.1

Weighted Double-Differencing Estimators

We introduced the SDID estimator (1.1) as the solution to a weighted two-way fixed effects
regression. For the purpose of our formal results, however, it is convenient to work with the
alternative characterization described above in Equation 4.3. For any weights ω ∈ Ω and λ ∈ Λ,
8

More specifically, as suggested by (1.3), SC is invariant to shifts in βt but not αi . In this context, we also
note that the DIFP estimator proposed by Doudchenko and Imbens [2016] and Ferman and Pinto [2019] that
center each unit’s trajectory before applying the synthetic control method is also invariant to shifts in αi .

(4.3)

One can verify that the basic DID estimator is of the form (4.3), with constant weights ωtr =
1/Ntr , etc. The proposed SDID estimator (1.1) can also be written as (4.3), but now with
weights ω̂ sdid and λ̂sdid solving (2.1) and (2.3) respectively. When there is no risk of ambiguity,
we will omit the SDID-superscript from the weights and simply write ω̂ and λ̂.
Now, note that for any choice of weights ω ∈ Ω and λ ∈ Λ, we have ωtr ∈ RNtr and
>
λpost ∈ RTpost with all elements equal to 1/Ntr and 1/Tpost respectively, and so ωtr
τtr,post λpost = τ .

Thus, we can decompose the error of any weighted double-differencing estimator with weights
satisfying these conditions as the sum of a bias and a noise component:

In order to characterize the distribution of τ̂ sdid − τ , it thus remains to carry out two tasks.
First, we need to understand the scale of the errors B(ω, λ) and ε(ω, λ), and second, we need to
understand how data-adaptivity of the weights ω̂ and λ̂ affects the situation.

4.2

Oracle and Adaptive Synthetic Control Weights

To address the adaptivity of the SDID weights ω̂ and λ̂ chosen via (2.1) and (2.3), we construct
alternative “oracle” weights that have similar properties to ω̂ and λ̂ in terms of eliminating
bias due to L, but are deterministic. We can then further decompose the error of τ̂ sdid into
the error of a weighted double-differencing estimator with the oracle weights and the difference
between the oracle and feasible estimators. Under appropriate conditions, we find the latter term
negligible relative to the error of the oracle estimator, opening the door to a simple asymptotic
9

This weighted double-differencing structure plays a key role in understanding the behavior of SDID. As
discussed further in Section 6, despite relying on a different motivation, certain specifications of the recently
proposed “augmented synthetic control” method of Ben-Michael, Feller, and Rothstein [2018] also result in a
weighted double-differencing estimator.

We define such oracle weights ω̃ and λ̃ by minimizing the expectation of the objective functions `unit (·) and `time (·) used in (2.1) and (2.3) respectively, and set

to the other error terms in (4.8).
Second, the oracle confounding bias will be small either when the pre-exposure oracle row

The upshot is even if one of the sets of weights fails to remove the bias from the presence of L,
the combination of weights ω̃ and λ̃ can compensate for such failures. This double robustness
property is similar to that of the augmented inverse probability weighting estimator, whereby
one can trade off between accurate estimates of the outcome and treatment assignment models
[Ben-Michael, Feller, and Rothstein, 2018, Scharfstein, Rotnitzky, and Robins, 1999].
We note that although poor fit in the oracle regressions on the unexposed rows and columns
of L will often be indicated by a poor fit in the realized regressions on the unexposed rows
and columns of Y , the assumption that one of these regressions generalizes to exposed rows or
columns is an identification assumption without clear testable implications. It is essentially an
assumption of no unexplained confounding: any exceptional behavior of the exposed observations, whether due to exposure or not, can be ascribed to it.
Third, our core theoretical claim, formalized in our asymptotic analysis, is that the SDID
estimator will be close to the oracle when the oracle unit and time weights look promising on

their respective training sets, i.e, when ω̃0 + ω̃co
Lco,pre ≈ ω̃tr
Ltr,pre and kω̃k2 is not too large and

λ̃0 + Lco,pre λ̃pre ≈ Lco,post λ̃post and kλ̃k2 is not too large. Although the details differ, as described
above these qualitative properties are also criteria for accuracy of the oracle estimator itself.
Finally, we comment briefly on the behavior of the oracle time weights λ̃ in the presence of
autocorrelation over time. When Σ is not diagonal, the effective regularization term in (4.7)
does not shrink λ̃pre towards zero, but rather toward an autoregression vector

(4.9)

Here λpost is the Tpost -component column vector with all elements equal to 1/Tpost and ψ is the
population regression coefficient in a regression of the average of the post-treatment errors on
the pre-treatment errors. In the absence of autocorrelation, ψ is zero, but when autocorrelation
is present, shinkage toward ψ reduces the variance of the SDID estimator—and enables us to
gain precision over the basic DID estimator (1.2) even when the two-way fixed effects model is
23

correctly specified. This explains some of the behavior noted in the simulations.

Asymptotic Properties

To carry out the analysis plan sketched above, we need to embed our problem into an asymptotic
setting. First, we require the error matrix E to satisfy some regularity properties.
Assumption 1. (Properties of Errors) The rows Ei of the noise matrix are independent
and identically distributed Gaussian vectors and the eigenvalues of its covariance matrix Σ are
bounded and bounded away from zero.
Next, we spell out assumptions about the sample size. At a high level, we want the panel to
be large (i.e., N, T → ∞), and for the number of treated cells of the panel to grow to infinity
but slower than the total panel size. We note in particular that we can accommodate sequences
where one of Tpost or Ntr is fixed, but not both.
Assumption 2. (Sample Sizes) We consider a sequence of populations where
(i) the product Ntr Tpost goes to infinity, and both Nco and Tpre go to infinity,
(ii) the ratio Tpre /Nco is bounded and bounded away from zero,
(iii) Nco /(Ntr Tpost max(Ntr , Tpost ) log2 (Nco )) → ∞.
We also need to make assumptions about the spectrum of L; in particular, L cannot have
too many large singular values, although we allow for the possibility of many small singular
values. A sufficient, but not necessary, condition for the assumption below is that the rank of
p
L is less than min(Tpre , Nco ). Notice that we do not assume any lower bounds for non-zero
singular values of L; in fact can accommodate arbitrarily many non-zero but very small singular
values, much like, e.g., Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen [2014] can accommodate arbitrarily
many non-zero but very small signal coefficients in a high-dimensional inference problem. We
p
need that the min(Tpre , Nco )th singular value of Lco,pre is sufficiently small. Formally:
Assumption 3. (Properties of L) Letting σ1 (Γ), σ2 (Γ), . . . denote the singular values of the

matrix Γ in decreasing order and R the largest integer less than min(Tpre , Nco ),

(4.10)

The last—and potentially most interesting—of our assumptions concerns the relation between the factor structure L and the assignment mechanism W . At a high level, it plays the
role of an identifying assumption, and guarantees that the oracle weights from (4.6) and (4.7)
that are directly defined in terms of L are able to adequately cancel out L via the weighted
double-differencing strategy. This requires that the optimization problems (4.6) and (4.7) accommodate reasonably dispersed weights, and that the treated units and after periods not be
too dissimilar from the control units and the before periods respectively.
Assumption 4. (Properties of Weights and L) The oracle unit weights ω̃ satisfy
kω̃co k2 = o([(Ntr Tpost ) log(Nco )]−1/2 )

and

Assumptions 1-4 are substantially weaker than those used to establish asymptotic normality of comparable methods.10 We do not require that double differencing alone removes the
individual and time effects as the DID assumptions do. Furthermore, we do not require that
unit comparisons alone are sufficient to remove the biases in comparisons between treated and
control units as the SC assumptions do. Finally, we do not require a low rank factor model to
10

In particular, note that our assumptions are satisfied in the well-specified two-way fixed effect setting model.
Suppose we have Lit = αi + βt with uncorrelated and homoskedastic errors, and that the sample size restrictions
in Assumption 2 are satisfied. Then Assumption 1 is automatically satisfied, and the rank condition on L from
Assumption
√ 3 is satisfied with R = 2. Next, we see that the oracle unit weights satisfy ω̃co,i
√ = 1/Nco so that
kω̃k2 = 1/ N co , and the oracle time weights satisfy λ̃pre,i = 1/Tpre so that kλ̃ − ψk2 = 1/ N co . Thus if the
restrictions on the rates at which the sample sizes increase in Assumption 2 are satisfied, then (4.11) and (4.12)
are satisfied. Finally, the additive structure of L implies that, as long as the weights for the controls sum to one,

be correctly specified, as is often assumed in the analysis of methods that estimate L explicitly
[e.g., Bai, 2009, Moon and Weidner, 2015, 2017]. Rather, we only need the combination of the
three bias-reducing components in the SDID estimator, (i) double differencing, (ii) the unit
weights, and (iii) the time weights, to reduce the bias to a sufficiently small level.
Our main formal result states that under these assumptions, our estimator is asymptotically
normal. Furthermore, its asymptotic variance is optimal, coinciding with the variance we would
get if we knew L and Σ a-priori and could therefore estimate τ by a simple average of τit plus

Large-Sample Inference

The asymptotic result from the previous section can be used to motivate practical methods for
large-sample inference using SDID. Under appropriate conditions, the estimator is asymptotically normal and zero-centered; thus, if these conditions hold and we have a consistent estimator
for its asymptotic variance Vτ , we can use conventional confidence intervals

to conduct asymptotically valid inference. In this section, we discuss three approaches to variance estimation for use in confidence intervals of this type.
The first proposal we consider, described in detail in Algorithm 2, involves a clustered bootstrap [Efron, 1979] where we independently resample units. As argued in Bertrand, Duflo, and
Mullainathan [2004], unit-level bootstrapping presents a natural approach to inference with
panel data when repeated observations of the same unit may be correlated with each other. The
bootstrap is simple to implement and, in our experiments, appears to yield robust performance
in large panels. The main downside of the bootstrap is that it may be computationally costly as
it involves running the full SDID algorithm for each bootstrap replication, and for large datasets
this can be prohibitively expensive.
To address this issue we next consider an approach to inference that is more closely tailored
to the SDID method and only involves running the full SDID algorithm once, thus dramatically
decreasing the computational burden. Given weights ω̂ and λ̂ used to get the SDID point estimate, Algorithm 3 applies the jackknife [Miller, 1974] to the weighted SDID regression (1.1), with

27

the weights treated as fixed. The validity of this procedure is not implied directly by asymptotic
linearity as in (4.14); however, as shown below, we still recover conservative confidence intervals
under considerable generality.
Theorem 2. Suppose that the elements of L are bounded. Then, under the conditions of Theorem 1, the jackknife variance estimator described in Algorithm 3 yields conservative confidence
intervals, i.e., for any 0 < α < 1,

(5.3)

i.e., the time weights λ̂ are predictive enough on the exposed units, then the jackknife yields exact
confidence intervals and (5.2) holds with equality.
In other words, we find that the jackknife is in general conservative and is exact when treated
and control units are similar enough that time weights that fit the control units generalize to
the treated units. This result depends on specific structure of the SDID estimator, and does
not hold for related methods such as the SC estimator. In particular, an analogue to Algorithm
3 for SC would be severely biased upwards, and would not be exact even in the well-specified
fixed effects model. Thus, we do not recommend (or report results for) this type of jackknifing
with the SC estimator. We do report results for jackknifing DID since, in this case, there are
no random weights ω̂ or λ̂ and so our jackknife just amounts to the regular jackknife.
Now, both the bootstrap and jackknife-based methods discussed so far are designed with the
setting of Theorem 1 in mind, i.e., for large panels with many treated units. These methods
may be less reliable when the number of treated units Ntr is small, and the jackknife is not even
defined when Ntr = 1. However, many applications of synthetic controls have Ntr = 1, e.g.,
the California smoking application from Section 2. To this end, we consider a third variance
estimator that is motivated by placebo evaluations as often considered in the literature on
11

When treatment effects are heterogeneous, the jackknife implicitly treats the estimand (4.2) as random
whereas we treat it as fixed, thus resulting in excess estimated variance; see Imbens [2004] for further discussion.

synthetic controls [Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2010, 2015], and that can be applied
with Ntr = 1. The main idea of such placebo evaluations is to consider the behavior of synthetic
control estimation when we replace the unit that was exposed to the treatment with different
units that were not exposed.12 Algorithm 4 builds on this idea, and uses placebo predictions
using only the unexposed units to estimate the noise level, and then uses it to get Vbτ and build
confidence intervals as in (5.1). See Bottmer et al. [2021] for a discussion of the properties of
such placebo variance estimators in small samples.
Validity of the placebo approach relies fundamentally on homoskedasticity across units, because if the exposed and unexposed units have different noise distributions then there is no way
we can learn Vτ from unexposed units alone. We also note that non-parametric variance estimation for treatment effect estimators is in general impossible if we only have one treated unit, and
so homoskedasticity across units is effectively a necessary assumption in order for inference to
be possible here.13 Algorithm 4 can also be seen as an adaptation of the method of Conley and
Taber [2011] for inference in DID models with few treated units and assuming homoskedasticity,
in that both rely on the empirical distribution of residuals for placebo-estimators run on control
units to conduct inference. We refer to Conley and Taber [2011] for a detailed analysis of this
class of algorithms.
Table 4 shows the coverage rates for the experiments described in Section 3.1 and 3.2, using
12

Such a placebo test is closely connected to permutation tests in randomization inference; however, in many
synthetic controls applications, the exposed unit was not chosen at random, in which case placebo tests do not
have the formal properties of randomization tests [Firpo and Possebom, 2018, Hahn and Shi, 2016], and so may
need to be interpreted via a more qualitative lens.
13
In Theorem 1, we also assumed homoskedasticity. In contrast to the case of placebo inference, however,
it’s likely that a similar result would also hold without homoskedasticity; homoskedasticity is used in the proof
essentially only to simplify notation and allow the use of concentration inequalities which have been proven in
the homoskedastic case but can be generalized.

Table 4: Coverage results for nominal 95% confidence intervals in the CPS and Penn World Table simulation setting from Tables 2 and 3. The first three columns show coverage of confidence
intervals obtained via the Placebo method. The second set of columns show coverage from the
jackknife method. The last set of columns show coverage from the clustered bootstrap. Unless
otherwise specified, all settings have N = 50 and T = 40 cells, of which at most Ntr = 10 units
and Tpost = 10 periods are treated. In rows 7-9, we reduce the number of treated cells. In rows
10 and 11, we artificially make the panel larger by adding rows, which makes the assumption
that the number of treated units is small relative to the number of control units more accurate
(we set Ntr to 10% of the total number of units). We do not report jackknife and bootstrap
coverage rates for Ntr = 1 because the estimators are not well-defined. We do not report jackknife coverage rates for SC because, as discussed in the text, the variance estimator is not well
justified in this case. All results are based on 400 simulation replications.

Gaussian confidence intervals (5.1) with variance estimates obtained as described above. In
the case of the SDID estimation, the bootstrap estimator performs particularly well, yielding
nearly nominal 95% coverage, while both placebo and jackknife variance estimates also deliver
results that are close to the nominal 95% level. This is encouraging, and aligned with our
previous observation that the SDID estimator appeared to have low bias. That being said,
when assessing the performance of the placebo estimator, recall that the data in Section 3.1
was generated with noise that is both Gaussian and homoskedastic across units—which were
assumptions that are both heavily used by the placebo estimator.
In contrast, we see that coverage rates for DID and SC can be relatively low, especially in
30

cases with significant bias such as the setting with the state unemployment rate as the outcome.
This is again in line with what one may have expected based on the distribution of the errors of
each estimator as discussed in Section 3.1, e.g., in Figure 2: If the point estimates τ̂ from DID
and SC are dominated by bias, then we should not expect confidence intervals that only focus
on variance to achieve coverage.

Related Work

Methodologically, our work draws most directly from the literature on SC methods, including
Abadie and Gardeazabal [2003], Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller [2010, 2015], Abadie and
L’Hour [2016], Doudchenko and Imbens [2016], and Ben-Michael, Feller, and Rothstein [2018].
Most methods in this line of work can be thought of as focusing on constructing unit weights
that create comparable (balanced) treated and control units, without relying on any modeling
or weighting across time. Ben-Michael, Feller, and Rothstein [2018] is an interesting exception.
Their augmented synthetic control estimator, motivated by the augmented inverse-propensity
weighted estimator of Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao [1994], combines synthetic control weights
with a regression adjustment for improved accuracy (see also Kellogg, Mogstad, Pouliot, and
Torgovitsky [2020] which explicitly connects SC to matching). They focus on the case of Ntr = 1
exposed units and Tpost = 1 post-exposure periods, and their method involves fitting a model
for the conditional expectation m(·) for YiT in terms of the lagged outcomes Yi,pre , and then
using this fitted model to “augment” the basic synthetic control estimator as follows.

Despite their different motivations, the augmented synthetic control and synthetic difference in
differences methods share an interesting connection: with a linear model m(·), τ̂sdid and τ̂asc are
very similar. In fact, had we fit ω̂ sdid without intercept, they would be equivalent for m̂(·) fit by
least squares on the controls, imposing the constraint that its coefficients are nonnegative and
to sum to one, that is, for m̂(Yi,pre ) = λ̂sdid
+ Yi,pre λ̂sdid

pre . This connection suggests that weighted
two-way bias-removal methods are a natural way of working with panels where we want to move
beyond simple difference in difference approaches.

31

We also note recent work of Roth [2018] and Rambachan and Roth [2019], who focus on
valid inference in difference in differences settings when users look at past outcomes to check for
parallel trends. Our approach uses past data not only to check whether the trends are parallel,
but also to construct the weights to make them parallel. In this setting, we show that one can
still conduct valid inference, as long as N and T are large enough and the size of the treatment
block is small.
In terms of our formal results, our paper fits broadly in the literature on panel models with
interactive fixed effects and the matrix completion literature [Athey et al., 2017, Bai, 2009, Moon
and Weidner, 2015, 2017, Robins, 1985, Xu, 2017]. Different types of problems of this form have
a long tradition in the econometrics literature, with early results going back to Ahn, Lee, and
Schmidt [2001], Chamberlain [1992] and Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen [1988] in the case of
finite-horizon panels (i.e., in our notation, under asymptotics where T is fixed and only N → ∞).
More recently, Freyberger [2018] extended the work of Chamberlain [1992] to a setting that’s
closely related to ours, and emphasized the role of the past outcomes for constructing moment
restrictions in the fixed-T setting. Freyberger [2018] attains identification by assuming that the
errors Eit are uncorrelated, and thus past outcomes act as valid instruments. In contrast, we
allow for correlated errors within rows, and thus need to work in a large-T setting.
Recently, there has considerable interest in models of type (3.2) under asymptotics where
both N and T get large. One popular approach, studied by Bai [2009] and Moon and Weidner
[2015, 2017], involves fitting (3.2) by “least squares”, i.e., by minimizing squared-error loss while
b to have bounded rank R. While these results do allow valid inference for τ , they
constraining L
require strong assumptions. First, they require the rank of L to be known a-priori (or, in the
case of Moon and Weidner [2015], require a known upper bound for its rank), and second, they
require a βmin -type condition whereby the normalized non-zero singular values of L are well
separated from zero. In contrast, our results require no explicit limit on the rank of L and allow
for L to have to have positive singular values that are arbitrarily close to zero, thus suggesting
that the SDID method may be more robust than the least squares method in cases where the
analyst wishes to be as agnostic as possible regarding properties of L.14

By analogy, we also note that, in the literature on high-dimensional inference, methods that do no assume a
uniform lower bound on the strength of non-zero coefficients of the signal vector are generally considered more
robust than ones that do [e.g., Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, 2014, Zhang and Zhang, 2014].

computational perspective; however, results for inference about τ that go beyond what was
available for least squares estimators are currently not available. We also note recent papers
that draw from these ideas in connection to synthetic control type analyses, including Chan and
Kwok [2020] and Gobillon and Magnac [2016]. Finally, in a paper contemporaneous to ours,
Agarwal, Shah, Shen, and Song [2019] provide improved bounds from principal component
regression in an errors-in-variables model closely related to our setting, and discuss implications
for estimation in synthetic control type problems. Relative to our results, however, Agarwal
et al. [2019] still require assumptions on the behavior of the small singular values of L, and do
not provide methods for inference about τ .
In another direction, several authors have recently proposed various methods that implicitly
control for the systematic component L in models of time (3.2). In one early example, Hsiao,
Steve Ching, and Ki Wan [2012] start with a factor model similar to ours and show that under
certain assumptions it implies the moment condition

for all t = 1, . . . , T . The authors then estimate βj by (weighted) OLS. This approach is further
refined by Li and Bell [2017], who additionally propose to penalizing the coefficients βj using
the lasso [Tibshirani, 1996]. In a recent paper, Chernozhukov, Wuthrich, and Zhu [2018] use
the model (6.2) as a starting point for inference.
While this line of work shares a conceptual connection with us, the formal setting is very
different. In order to derive a representation of the type (6.2), one essentially needs to assume
a random specification for (3.2) where both L and E are stationary in time. Li and Bell [2017]
explicitly assumes that the outcomes Y themselves are weakly stationary, while Chernozhukov,
Wuthrich, and Zhu [2018] makes the same assumption to derive the results that are valid under
general misspecification. In our results, we do not assume stationarity anywhere: L is taken as
deterministic and the errors E may be non-stationary. Moreover, in the case of most synthetic
control and difference in differences analyses, we believe stationarity to be a fairly restrictive
assumption. In particular, in our model, stationarity would imply that a simple pre-post com-

33

parison for exposed units would be an unbiased estimator of τ and, as a result, the only purpose
of the unexposed units would be to help improve efficiency. In contrast, in our analysis, using
unexposed units for double-differencing is crucial for identification.
Ferman and Pinto [2019] analyze the performance of synthetic control estimator using essentially the same model as we do. They focus on the situations where N is small, while Tpre (the
number of control periods) is growing. They show that unless time factors have strong trends
(e.g., polynomial) the synthetic control estimator is asymptotically biased. Importantly Ferman
and Pinto [2019] focus on the standard synthetic control estimator, without time weights and
regularization, but with an intercept in the construction of the weights.
Finally, from a statistical perspective, our approach bears some similarity to the work on
“balancing” methods for program evaluation under unconfoundedness, including Athey, Imbens,
and Wager [2018], Graham, Pinto, and Egel [2012], Hirshberg and Wager [2017], Imai and
Ratkovic [2014], Kallus [2020], Zhao [2019] and Zubizarreta [2015]. One major result of this line
of work is that, by algorithmically finding weights that balance observed covariates across treated
and control observations, we can derive robust estimators with good asymptotic properties (such
as efficiency). In contrast to this line of work, rather than balancing observed covariates, we here
need to balance unobserved factors Γ and Υ in (3.2) to achieve consistency; and accounting for
this forces us to follow a different formal approach than existing studies using balancing methods.

Placebo Study Details

For the placebo studies we use three indicators Di to estimate the assignment model via logistic regression as described in (3.5). The first is equal to an indicator that state i has
a minimum wage that is higher than the federal minimum wage in the year 2000.

This

indicator was taken from http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/stateMinWageHis.htm; see Barrios et al. [2012] for details. The second indicator comes from a state having an open-carry
gun law. This was taken from https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/
guns-in-public/open-carry/. The third indicator comes from the state not having a ban on
partial birth abortions. This was taken from https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/
explore/overview-abortion-laws. Table 5 presents the values for these indicators.

Staggered Adoption

In the paper so far we have focused on the case where some units start receiving the treatment at
a common point in time, what Athey et al. [2017] call block assignment. Under block assignment
the N × T matrix of treatment assignments W has the form like the following matrix, where
units 3-6 all adopt the treatment in period 5:

 1

 2

W =
 3
 4

 5

This is a common setting, but there are other settings that are of interest. Another important
special case is that of staggered adoption (e.g., Athey and Imbens [2021]) with multiple dates at
which the treatment is started. For example, in the following assignment matrix units 5 and 6
adopt the treatment in period 3, and units 3 and 4 adopt the treatment in period 5 (and units
1 and 2 never adopt the treatment):


With staggered adoption the weighted DID regression approach in SDID does not work directly.
However, there are various alternatives. Here we discuss a simple modification to estimate the
average treatment effect for the treated in that setting by applying the SDID estimator repeatedly, once for every adoption date. An alternative is the procedure developed in Ben-Michael
et al. [2019]. In the above example with two adoption dates, we can create two assignment
matrices, W 1 and W 2 , that both fit into the block assignment setting. We can then apply the
SDID estimator to both samples, and calculated a weighted average of the two estimators, with
the weight equal to the fraction of treated unit/time-period pairs in each of the two samples. In
46

the above example, the first sample would consist of units 1, 2, 5 and 6, and the second sample
would consist of units 1, 2, 3, and 4, as illustrated in the two assignment matrices below:

Formal Results

In this section, we will outline the proof of Theorem 1. Recall from Section 4.2 the decomposition
of the SDID estimator’s error into three terms: oracle noise, oracle confounding bias, and the
deviation of the SDID estimator from the oracle. Our main task is bounding the deviation
term. To do this, we prove an abstract high-probability bound, then derive a more concrete
bound using results from a companion paper on penalized high-dimensional least squares with

errors in variable [Hirshberg, 2021], and then show that this bound is o (Ntr Tpost )−1/2 under
the assumptions of Theorem 1. Detailed proofs for each step are included in the next section.
Notation Throughout, each instance of c will denote a potentially different universal constant;
a . b, a  b, and a ∼ b will mean a ≤ cb, a/b → 0, and c ≤ a/b ≤ c respectively. kvk and kAk
will denote the Euclidean norm kvk2 for a vector v and the operator norm supkvk2 ≤1 kAvk for
a matrix A respectively; σ1 (A), σ2 (A), . . . will denote the singular values of A; Ai· and A·j will
denote the ith row and jth column of A; v 0 and A0 will denote the transposes of a vector v and

matrix A; and [v; w] ∈ Rm+n will denote the concatenation of vectors v ∈ Rm and w ∈ Rn .

Abstract Setting

We will begin by describing an abstract setting that arises as a condensed form of the setting
considered in our formal results in Section 4. We observe an N × T matrix Y , which we will
decompose as the sum Yit = Lit +1(i = N, j = T )τ +ε of a deterministic matrix L and a random
matrix ε. We will refer to four blocks,

Y =

Y:: Y:T
YN : YN T


,

where Y:: is a submatrix that omits the last row and column, YN : is the last row omitting its last
element, and Y:T is the last column omitting its last element. We will use analogous notation
for the parts of L and ε and let N0 = N − 1 and T0 = T − 1.
We assume that rows of ε are independent and subgaussian and that for i ≤ N0 they are
identically distributed with linear post-on-pretreatment autoregression function E[εiT | εi: ] =
εi: ψ and covariance Σ = E ε0i· εi· and let ΣN be the covariance matrix of εN · . We will refer to the
covariance of the subvectors εi: and εN : as Σ:: and ΣN
:: respectively.
Our abstract results involve a bound K characterizing the concentration of the rows εi· .

Here we follow the convention [e.g., Vershynin, 2018] that the subgaussian norm of a random
vector ξ is kξkψ2 := supkxk≤1 kx0 ξkψ2 . The conditional subgaussian norm k·kψ2 |Z is defined like
the subgaussian norm the conditional distribution given Z. When the rows of ε are gaussian
vectors, these conditions are satisfied for K equal to a sufficiently large universal constant. In the
gaussian case, ε1T −ε1: ψ is independent of εi: , the squared subgaussian norm of a gaussian random
vector is bounded by a multiple of the operator norm of its covariance, and the concentration
of kε1: k2 as above is implied by the Hanson-Wright inequality [e.g., Vershynin, 2018, Theorem
6.2.1].

Concrete Setting

We map from the setting considered in Section 4 to our condensed form by averaging within
blocks as follows.

Here λpost ∈ RTpost and ωtr ∈ RNtr are vectors with equal weight 1/Tpost and 1/Ntr respectively.
When working with this condensed form, we write ω and λ for what is rendered ωco and λtr in
Section 4. We will also use Ω and Λ to denote the sets that would be written {ωco : ω ∈ Ω} and
{λpre : λ ∈ Λ} in the notation used in Equations 2.1 and 2.3. Note that these sets Ω and Λ are
the unit simplex in RN0 = RNco and RT0 = RTpre respectively.
In this condensed form, rows εi· are independent gaussian vectors with mean zero and covariance matrix Σ for i ≤ N0 and Ntr−1 Σ for i = N . This matrix Σ satisfies, with quantities on
the right defined as in Section 4,

Σ=

Note that because all rows have the same covariance up to scale, they have the same autoregression vector, ψ = arg minv∈RT0 E(εi: v − εiT )2 . This definition is equivalent to the one given in
Section 4. And this characterization of εi: ψ as a least squares projection implies that εi: ψ − εiT
and εi: are uncorrelated and, being jointly normal, therefore independent.
That the eigenvalues of non-condensed-form Σ are bounded and bounded away from zero
implies that the eigenvalues of the submatrix Σ:: = Σpre,pre are bounded and bounded away from
zero. Furthermore, it implies the variance of εi: ψ − εiT is on the order of 1/Tpost .
To show this, we establish an upper and lower bound of that order. We will write σmin (Σ)
and σmax (Σ) for the smallest and largest eigenvalues of Σ. For the lower bound, we calculate
its variance E (εi· · [ψ; −λpost ])2 = [ψ; −λpost ] Σ [ψ; −λpost ], and observe that this is at least
k[ψ; −λpost ]k2 σmin (Σ). This implies an order 1/Tpost lower bound, as k[ψ; −λpost ]k2 ≥ kλpost k2 =
1/Tpost . For the upper bound, observe that because εiT − εi: ψ is the orthogonal projection of εiT
on a subspace, specifically the subspace orthogonal to {εi: v : v ∈ RTpre }, its variance is bounded
by that of εiT . This is [0; λpost ] Σ [0; λpost ] ≤ σmax (Σ)kλpost k2 = σmax (Σ)/Tpost .

Theorem 1 in Condensed Form

In the abstract setting we’ve introduced above, we can write a weighted difference-in-differences
treatment effect estimator as the difference between our (aggregate) treated observation YN T and
an estimate ŶN T of the corresponding (aggregate) control potential outcome. In the concrete
setting considered in Section 4, this coincides with the estimator defined in (4.3).
τ̂ (λ, ω) = YN T − ŶN T (λ, ω) where ŶN T (λ, ω) := YN : λ + ω 0 Y:T − ω 0 Y:: λ.

(9.2)

And the following weights coincide with the definitions used in Section 4.
ω̂0 , ω̂ = arg min kω0 + ω 0 Y:: − YN : k2 + ζ 2 T0 kωk2 ,
ω0 ,ω∈R×Ω

ω̃0 , ω̃ = arg min kω0 + ω 0 L:: − LN : k2 + (ζ 2 + σ 2 )T0 kωk2 ,
ω0 ,ω∈R×Ω

(9.3)

λ̂0 , λ̂ = arg min kλ0 + Y:: λ − Y:T k2 ,
λ0 ,λ∈R×Λ

λ̃0 , λ̃ = arg min kλ0 + L:: λ − L:T k2 + N0 kΣ::1/2 (λ − ψ)k2 .
λ0 ,λ∈R×Λ

The following assumptions on the condensed form hold in the setting considered in Theorem 1. The first summarizes our condensed-form model. The second is implied by Assumption 1
for N1 = Ntr and T1 ∼ Tpost as described above in Section 9.2. And the remaining three are
condensed-form restatements of Assumptions 2-4, differing only in that we substitute T1 ∼ Tpost
for Tpost itself.
Assumption 5 (Model). We observe Yit = Lit + 1(i = N, t = T )τ + εit for deterministic τ ∈ R
and L ∈ RN ×T and random ε ∈ RN ×T . And we define N0 = N − 1 and T = T0 − 1.
Assumption 6 (Properties of Errors). The rows εi· of the noise matrix are independent gaussian
vectors with mean zero and covariance matrix Σ for i ≤ N0 and N1−1 Σ for i = N where the
eigenvalues of Σ:: are bounded and bounded away from zero. Here N1 > 0 can be arbitrary and
we define T1 = 1/ Var[εi: ψ − εiT ] and ψ = arg minv∈RT0 E(εi: v − εiT )2 .
Assumption 7 (Sample Sizes). We consider a sequence of problems where T0 /N0 is bounded and
bounded away from zero, T1 and N1 are bounded away from zero, and N0 /(N1 T1 max(N1 , T1 ) log2 (N0 )) →
∞.

Assumption 9 (Properties of Oracle Weights). We use weights as in (9.3) for
ζ  (N1 T1 )1/4 log1/2 (N0 ) and the oracle weights satisfy
(i) max(kω̃k, kλ̃ − ψk)  (N1 T1 )−1/2 log−1/2 (N0 ),

(iii) LN T − ω̃ 0 L:T − LN : λ̃ + ω̃ 0 L:: λ̃  (N1 T1 )−1/2 .
The following condensed form asymptotic linearity result implies Theorem 1.
Theorem 3. If Assumptions 5-9 hold, then τ̂ (λ̂, ω̂) − τ = εN T − εN : ψ + op ((N1 T1 )−1/2 ).
The following lemma reduces its proof to demonstrating the negligibility of the difference
∆oracle := τ̂ (ω̂, λ̂) − τ̂ (ω̃, λ̃) between the SDID estimator and the corresponding oracle estimator.
Its proof is a straightforward calculation. Note that the bounds it requires on the oracle weights
are looser than what is required by Assumption 9(i); those tighter bounds are used to control
∆oracle .

Lemma 4. If deterministic ω̃, λ̃ satisfy kω̃k = o(N1

) and Assump-

tions 5, 6, and 9(iii) hold, then τ̂ (ω̃, λ̃) − τ = εN T − εN : ψ + op ((N1 T1 )−1/2 ).
To show that this difference ∆oracle is small, we use bounds on the difference between the
estimated and oracle weights based on Hirshberg [2021, Theorem 1]. We summarize these bounds
in Lemma 5 below.
Lemma 5. If Assumptions 5, 6, and 8 hold; T1 and N1 are bounded away from zero; N0 , T0 → ∞
with N0 ≥ log2 (T0 ) and T0 ≥ log2 (N0 ); and we choose weights as in (9.3) for unit simplices Ω ⊆ RN0 and Λ ⊆ RT0 , then the following bounds hold on an event of probability

We conclude by using bounds of this form, in conjunction with the first order orthogonality
of the weighted difference-in-differences estimator τ̂ (λ, ω) to the weights λ and ω, to control
∆oracle . We do this abstractly in Lemma 6, then derive from it a simplified bound from which
it will be clear that ∆oracle = op ((N1 T1 )−1/2 ) under our assumptions.

and the latter two bounds go to infinity.
These assumptions are implied by Assumptions 5-9. Assumption 7 states our assumptions
53

T0 ∼ N0 , log(N0 ), T1 , N1 6→ 0, and that the (fourth power of) the second bound above goes to
infinity; when the second bound does go to infinity, so does the third. As Assumption 7 implies
that that T0 ∼ N0 → ∞, it implies the probability stated in the lemma above goes to one. And
Assumption 9(i-ii) states that the bound above hold.
As our assumptions imply the conclusions of Lemma 4 and Corollary 7, and those two results
imply the conclusions of Theorem 3, this concludes our proof.

10

Proof Details

In this section, we complete our proof by proving the lemmas used in the sketch above.

10.1

Proof of Lemma 4

First, consider the oracle estimator’s bias,
E τ̂ (λ̃, ω̃) − τ = (LN T + τ ) − ω̃ 0 L:T − LN : λ̃ + ω̃ 0 L:: λ̃ − τ.
Assumption 9(iii) is that this is op ((N1 T1 )−1/2 ).
Now consider the oracle estimator’s variation around its mean,
τ̂ (λ̃, ω̃) − E τ̂ (λ̃, ω̃) = εN T − εN : λ̃ + ω̃ 0 ε:T + ω̃ 0 ε:: λ̃
= (εN T − εN : λ̃) − ω̃ 0 (ε:T − ε:: λ̃)
= (εN T − εN : ψ) − ω̃ 0 (ε:T − ε:: ψ) − εN : (λ̃ − ψ) + ω̃ 0 ε:: (λ̃ − ψ).
The conclusion of our lemma holds if all but the first term in the decomposition above are
op ((N1 T1 )−1/2 ). We do this by showing that each term has o((N1 T1 )−1 ) variance.
E(ω̃ 0 (ε:T − ε:: ψ))2 = kω̃k2 E(ε1T − εi: ψ)2 = kω̃k2 /T1 ,
E(εN : (λ̃ − ψ))2 = (λ̃ − ψ)0 (E ε0N : εN : )(λ̃ − ψ) ≤ kλ̃ − ψk2 kΣ:: k/N1 ,
E(ω̃ 0 ε:: (λ̃ − ψ))2 = kω̃k2 E(ε1: (λ̃ − ψ))2 ≤ kω̃k2 kλ̃k2 kΣ:: k.
Our assumption that kΣ:: k is bounded and our assumed bounds on kω̃k and kλ̃k imply that
54

each of these is o((N1 T1 )−1 ) as required.

10.2

Proof of Lemma 5

The bounds involving λ follow from the application of Hirshberg [2021, Theorem 1] with η 2 = 1,
p
A = L:: , b = L:T , and [ε, ν] = [ε:: , ε:T ] with independent rows, using the bound w(Λ?s ) . log(T0 )
mentioned in its Example 1. The bounds for ω follow from the application of the same theorem
with η 2 = 1 + ζ 2 /σ 2 for σ 2 = tr(Σ:: )/T0 , A = L0:: , b = L0N : , and [ε, ν] = ε0:: , ε0N : ] with independent
p
columns, using the analogous bound w(Ω?s ) . log(N0 ).
In the first case, Hirshberg [2021, Theorem 1] gives bounds of the claimed form for

and

R ≤ min(v 2 (N0 Tef f )1/2 , v 2 N0 / log(T0 ), cN0 ).
To see this, ignore constant order factors of φ (≥ 1) and kΣk in Hirshberg [2021, Theorem 1]

and substitute s2 = cv 2 rλ2 /(η 2 n) for problem-appropriate parameters η 2 = 1, n = N0 , nef f =

Tef f (≥ T1 ), and w̄(Θs ) = log(T0 ).
In the second case, Hirshberg [2021, Theorem 1] gives bounds of the claimed form for

R ≤ min(v 2 (T0 Nef f )1/2 , v 2 η 2 T0 / log(N0 ), cT0 ).
To see this, ignore constant order factors of φ (≥ 1) and kΣk in Hirshberg [2021, Theorem 1]

nef f = Nef f (≥ N1 ), and w̄(Θs ) = log(N0 ).
We will now simplify our conditions on R. As we have assumed that N1 and T1 and
therefore Nef f and Tef f are bounded away from zero, we can choose v of constant order with
v ≥ max(c/Tef f , c/Nef f , 1), so our upper bounds on R simplify to
1/2

R ≤ min(N0 , N0 / log(T0 ), cN0 )

and

1/2

R ≤ min(T0 , η 2 T0 / log(N0 ), T0 )
55

respectively. Having assumed that that N0 , T0 → ∞ with N0 ≥ log2 (T0 ) and T0 ≥ log2 (N0 ),
1/2

these conditions simplify to R ≤ N0

1/2

and R ≤ T0 . Thus, it suffices that the largest integer
−1/2

R ≤ min(N0 , T0 )1/2 satisfy σR+1 (L:: )/R ≤ c min(N1

−1/2

log−1/2 (N0 ), T1

log−1/2 (T0 )). This is

implied, for any constant c, by Assumption 8.
We conclude by simplifing our probability statements.

As noted above, we take R ∼

min(N0 , T0 )1/2 , so we may make this substitution. Furthermore, again using our assumption

Thus, each bound holds with probability at least 1 − c exp(−c min(N0 , T0 , N0 /kL:: λ̃ + λ̃0 −
L:T k, T0 /kω̃ 0 L:: + ω̃0 − LN : k)). And by the union bound, doubling our leading constant c, both
simultaneously with such a probability.

Proof of Lemma 6

We begin with a decomposition of the difference between the SDID estimator and the oracle.

= (YN : − ω̃ 0 Y:: )(λ̂ − λ̃) + (ω̂ − ω̃)0 (Y:T − Y:: λ̃) − (ω̂ − ω̃)0 Y:: (λ̂ − λ̃).
We bound these terms. As Yit = Lit + 1(i = N, t = T )τ + ε, we can decompose each of these
three terms into two parts, one involving L and the other ε. We will begin by treating the parts

56

involving ε.
1. The first term is a sum εN : (λ̂ − λ̃) − ω̃ 0 ε:: (λ̂ − λ̃). Because λ̂ is independent of εN : ,
the first of these is subgaussian conditional on λ̂, with conditional subgaussian norm

with conditional probability 1 − 2 exp(−u2 ). This implies that the same bound holds
unconditionally on an event of probability 1 − 2 exp(−u2 ).
Furthermore, via generic chaining [e.g., Vershynin, 2018, Theorem 8.5.5], on an event of

probability 1−2 exp(−u2 ), either Σ:: (λ̂−λ̃) 6∈ Λ?sλ or |ω̃ 0 ε:: (λ̂−λ̃)| ≤ ckω̃ 0 ε:: Σ::

lows from Hoeffding’s inequality [e.g., Vershynin, 2018, Theorem 2.6.3]. Thus, by the union
bound, on the intersection of an event of probability 1 − c exp(−u2 ) and one on which (9.4)

2. The second term is similar to the first. It is a sum (ω̂ − ω̃)0 ε̃:T + (ω̂ − ω̃)0 ε:: (ψ − λ̃) for
ε̃:T = ε:T − ε:: ψ. Because ω̂ is a function of ε:: , εN : and ε̃:T is mean zero conditional on
them, the first of these terms is a weighted average of conditionally independent mean-zero
subgaussian random variables. Applying Hoeffding’s inequality conditionally, it follows
that its magnitude is bounded by cukω̂ − ω̃k maxi<N kε̃iT kψ2 |ε::,εN : ≤ cuKkω̂ − ω̃kkε̃1T kL2
on an event of probability 1 − 2 exp(−u2 ). In the second comparison, we’ve used the
independence of rows εi· , the identical distribution of rows for i < N , and the assumption
that kε̃1T kψ2 |ε1: ≤ Kkε̃1T kL2 .
Furthermore, via generic chaining, on an event of probability 1 − c exp(−u2 ), either (ω̂ −

ω̃) 6∈ Ω?sω or |(ω̂ − ω̃)ε:: (ψ − λ̃)| ≤ ckε:: (ψ − λ̃)kψ2 (w(Ω?sω ) + u rad(Ω?sω )) ≤ cKkΣ:: (ψ −
λ̃)k(w(Ω?sω )+u rad(Ω?sω )). The second comparison here follows from Hoeffding’s inequality.
Thus, by the union bound, on the intersection of an event of probability 1 − c exp(−u2 )

and one on which (9.4) holds,
|(ω̂ − ω̃)0 (ε:T − ε:: λ̃)|

c exp(−u2 ), either (ω̂−ω̃) 6∈ Ω?sω , (λ̂−λ̃) 6∈ Λ?sλ , or |(ω̂−ω̃)0 ε:: (λ̂−λ̃)| ≤ cK[w(Ω?sω ) rad(Σ:: Λ?sλ )+

On the intersection of this event and one on which (9.4) holds, the first two possibilities
are ruled out and our bound on |(ω̂ − ω̃)0 ε:: (λ̂ − λ̃)| holds.
By the union bound, these three bounds are satisfied on the intersection of one of probability
1 − c exp(−u2 ) and one on which (9.4) holds. And by the triangle inequality, adding our bounds
yields a bound on our terms involving ε.

We now turn our attention to the terms involving L. For any ω0 , ω ∈ R × RN0 , (LN : −
ω̃ 0 L:: )(λ̂ − λ̃) = (LN : − ω 0 L:: − ω0 )(λ̂ − λ̃) + (ω − ω̃)0 L:: (λ̂ − λ̃). The value of the constant
ω0 does not affect the expression because the sum of the elements of λ̂ − λ̃ is zero. By the
Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities, it follows that
|(LN : − ω̃ 0 L:: )(λ̂ − λ̃)| ≤ k(LN : − ω 0 L:: − ω0 )Σ::−1/2 kkΣ::1/2 (λ̂ − λ̃)k + kω − ω̃kkL:: (λ̂ − λ̃)k
Furthermore, substituting bounds implied by (9.4) and using the elementary bound x + y ≤

Lemma 8. For any real matrix A and appropriately shaped vectors x̃ and b, minx α2 kAx − bk2 +
β 2 kx − x̃k2 = α2 kS 1/2 (Ax̃ − b)k2 for S = I − A(A0 A + (β/α)2 I)−1 A0 . If β = 0, the same holds
for S = I − A(A0 A)† A.
Proof. Reparameterizing in terms of y = x − x̃ and defining v = Ax̃ − b and λ2 = β 2 /α2 , this is
α2 times miny kv + Ayk2 + λ2 kyk2 = miny kvk2 + 2y 0 A0 v + y 0 (A0 A + λ2 I)y. Setting the derivative
of the expression to zero, we solve for the minimizer y = −(A0 A + λ2 I)−1 A0 v and the minimum
v 0 [I − A(A0 A + λ2 I)−1 A0 ]v, then multiply by α2 .
Analogously, for any λ0 , λ ∈ R × RT0 ,
|(ω̂ − ω̃)0 (L:T − L:: λ̃)| ≤ kL:T − L:: λ − λ0 kkω̂ − ω̃k + kλ − λ̃kk(ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: k.
and therefore, when (9.4) holds,

Finally, we can take the minimum of two Cauchy-Schwarz bounds on the third term,
|(ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: (λ̂ − λ̃)| = |[(ω̂0 − ω̃0 ) + (ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: ](λ̂ − λ̃)|
≤ k(ω̂0 − ω̃0 ) + (ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: kkΣ::−1/2 kkΣ1/2
:: (λ̂ − λ̃)k,
|(ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: (λ̂ − λ̃)| = |(ω̂ − ω̃)0 [(λ̂0 − λ̃0 ) + L:: (λ̂ − λ̃)]|
≤ kω̂ − ω̃kk(λ̂0 − λ̃0 ) + L:: (λ̂ − λ̃)k.
As above, the inclusion of either intercept does not effect the value of the expression because

59

λ̂ − λ̃ and ω̂ − ω̃ sum to one. This implies that on an event on which the bounds (9.4) hold,
|(LN : − ω̃ 0 L:: )(λ̂ − λ̃) + (ω̂ − ω̃)0 (L:T − Lλ̃) − (ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: (λ̂ − λ̃)|

(10.2)

We can include in the minimum in the third term above another bound on |(ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: (λ̂ − λ̃)|.
We will use one that exploits a potential gap in the spectrum of L:: , e.g., a bound on the
smallest nonzero singular value of L:: . The abstract bound we will use is one on the inner
product x0 Ay: given bounds kx0 Ak ≤ rx , kAyk ≤ ry , kxk ≤ sx , kyk ≤ sy , it is no larger than
mink σk (A)−1 rx ry + σk+1 (A)sx sy . To show this, we first observe that without loss of generality,
we can let A be square, diagonal, and nonnegative with decreasing elemnts on the diagonal: in
terms of its singular value decomposition A = U SV 0 and xU = U 0 x and yV = V 0 y, x0 Ay = x0U SyV
where kx0U Sk ≤ rx , kSyV k ≤ ry , kxU k ≤ sx , kyV k ≤ sy . In this simplified diagonal case, letting

We apply this with x = ω̂ − ω̃, y = λ̂ − λ̃, and A = L:: − N0−1 1N0 10N0 L:: − L:: T0−1 1T0 10T0 ; because
(ω̂ − ω̃)0 1N0 = 0 and 10T0 (λ̂ − λ̃) = 0, (ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: (λ̂ − λ̃) = (ω̂ − ω̃)0 A(λ̂ − λ̃) = x0 Ay. When the

These bounds also imply kxk ≤ σ −1 sω and kyk ≤ kΣ::

|(ω̂ − ω̃)0 L:: (λ̂ − λ̃)| ≤ min σk (A)−1 rλ rω + σ −1 kΣ::−1/2 kσk+1 (A)sλ sω

Adding together (10.1) and (10.2), including this additional bound in the minimum in the
third term of (10.2), we get the claimed bound on |τ (λ̃, ω̃) − τ̂ (λ̂, ω̂)|.

10.4

Proof of Corollary 7

We begin with the bound from Lemma 6. As the claimed bound is stated up to an unspecified
universal constant, we can ignore universal constants throughout. We can ignore K as well; as
discussed in Section 9.1, as in the gaussian case we consider, it can be taken to be a universal
constant. Furthermore, we can ignore all appearances of powers of σ, Σ:: , and Sθ for θ ∈ {λ, ω},

using bounds w(Σk:: ·) ≤ kΣk:: k w(·), kΣk:: ·k ≤ kΣk kk·k, and kSθ ·k ≤ kSθ kk·k and observing
that kSθ k ≤ 1 by construction and, under Assumption 6, kΣ:: k and kΣ−1
:: k are bounded by
universal constants. And we bound minima over ω0 and λ̃0 by substituting ω̃0 and λ̃0 . Then, as

w(Λ?sλ ) . log(T0 ) and w(Ω?sω ) . log(N0 ), Lemma 5 and Lemma 6 together (taking σ = 1 in

Taking u = min(Tef f log1/2 (T0 ), Nef f log1/2 (N0 ), (η 2 N0 T0 )1/2 M ), we can ignore the first line in
the bound above, as its three terms are bounded by the second term in the second line, the first
term in the second line, and the final term respectively. Grouping terms with common powers
of rω , rλ ; redefining Eλ = max(Eλ , 1) and Eω = max(Eω , 1), and expanding rω , rλ yields the
following bound.

(10.3)
Each term is multiplied by either log1/2 (T0 ), log1/2 (N0 ), or their geometric mean. For simplicity,
we will substitute a common upper bound of `1/2 for ` = log(max(N0 , T0 )). To establish our
claim, we must show that each term is o((N1 T1 )−1/2 ).
The first line of our bound is small enough, Nef f ∼ N1 , and Tef f ∼ T1 , if

To see this, multiply the square root of the first bound by the first part of the third when
1/2

bounding the term involving Eλ Eω and the square root of the second by the second part of the
1/2

third when bounding the term involving Eω Eλ . Note that because our ‘redefinition’ of Eω , Eλ
requires that they be no smaller than one, these upper bounds must go to infinity, and so long
as they do we can interpret them as bounds on kL0:: ω̃ + ω̃0 − L0N : k, kL:: λ̃ + λ̃0 − L:T k, and their
geometric mean respectively.
By substituting the bounds (10.5) into the term with a factor of M in (10.3), we can derive a

62

sufficent condition for it to be small enough. To see that it is sufficient, we bound first multiple
of M in (10.3) using the first bound on M below, the second using the second in combination
with our bound on Eω , the third using the third in combination with our bound on Eλ , and the
fourth using the second in combination with our first bound on (Eω Eλ )1/2 .

Equations 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6, so long as the bounds in (10.5) all go to infinity, are sufficient to

−1/2

N0

, (10.4) implies an additional constraint on the dimensions of the problem, N0  N1 T1 `.

Having established these bounds on Eω and Eλ , we are now in a position to characterize
the probability that our result holds by lower bounding the ratios N0 /Eλ and T0 /Eω that ap3/4

pear in the probability statement of Lemma 5. As N0 /Eλ  N0

3/4

and T0 /Eω  T0 , the

claims of Lemma 5 hold with probability 1 − c exp(−v) for v = c min(N0 , T0 )1/2 . Thus, recalling
from above that we are working on an event of probability 1 − c exp(−u2 ) − c exp(−v) for u =
1/2

1/2

min(Tef f log1/2 (T0 ), Nef f log1/2 (N0 ), (η 2 N0 T0 )1/2 M ) and that Nef f ∼ N1 and Tef f ∼ T1 , this is

probability at least 1−2 exp(− min(T1 log(T0 ), N1 log(N0 ), η 2 N0 T0 M 2 ))−c exp(−c min(N0 , T0 )).
We will now derive simplfied sufficient conditions under the assumption that N0 ∼ T0 . Let
m0 = N0 , m1 = (N1 T1 )1/2 , and m̄1 = max(N1 , T1 ). Then (10.6) holds if

in our probability statement above, our claims hold with probability

1 − 2 exp(− min(T1 log(T0 ), N1 log(N0 ))) − c exp(−cm0 )).
To avoid complicating the statement of our result, we will not explore refinements made
possible by a nontrivially large gap in the spectrum of Lc:: , i.e., the case that M = mink σk (Lc:: )−1 +
σk+1 (Lc:: )(η 2 N0 T0 )−1/2 . However, in models with no weak factors, this quantity will be very small,
and as a result, Equations 10.4 and 10.5 will essentially be sufficient to imply our claim. As we
make η large only to control M when it is equal to (ηT0 )−1/2 , this provides some justification for
the use of weak regularization (ζ small) or no regularization (ζ = 0) when fitting the synthetic
control ω̂.
1/2

We conclude by observing that the lower bound on ζ above simplifies to ζ  m1 `1/2 under
our stated assumptions. We begin with the assumption that the above upper bound on Eω
1/4

goes to infinity. Observing that the other lower bound on ζ as stated above is m̄1

times
1/4

the reciprocal of the this infinity-tending bound on Eω , it follows that it must be o(m̄1 ).

As m1

assumption, m̄1

= O(m1 `1/2 ), so this other lower bound is indeed smaller than the (other)

one that we retain.

Proof of Theorem 2

Throughout this proof, we will assume constant treatment effects τij = τ . When treatment
effects are not constant, the jackknife variance estimate will include an additional nonnegative
term that depends on the amount of treatment heterogeneity, making the inference conservative.
We will write a ∼p b meaning a/b →p 1, a .p b meaning a = Op (b), a p b meaning
a = op (b), σmin (Σ) and σmax (Σ) for the smallest and largest eigenvalues of a matrix Σ, and
1n ∈ Rn for a vector of ones. And we write λ̂? to denote the concatenation of λ̂pre and −λ̂post .

A few simplifications are now in order. We use the bound kω̂co k2  (Ntr Tpost log(Nco ))−1
derived in Section 11.0.1 below. This bound implies that the denominators 1 − ω̂i appearing in
the expression above all lie in the interval [1 − max(kω̂co k, Ntr−1 ), 1] = [1 − op (1), 1]. As each
term in that expression is nonnegative, it follows that the ratio between it and the expression
below, derived by replacing these denominators with 1, is in this interval and therefore converges
to one.

We will simplify this further by showing that the first term is negligible relative to the second.
We’ll start by lower bounding the second term. This is straightforward because for i > Nco , the

As σmin (Σ) is bounded away from zero, it follows that the mean of the second term in (11.4) is on
the order of (Ntr Tpost )−1 or larger. We’ll now show that the first term in (11.4) is op ((Ntr Tpost )−1 ),
so (11.4) is equivalent to a variant in which we have dropped its first term.

This simplification is as we would hope given that, under the conditions of Theorem 1, we found

Because the first term is nonnegative, our variance estimate is asymptotically either unbiased
or upwardly biased, so our confidence intervals are conservative as claimed. In the remainder,
we derive a sufficient condition for the first term to be asymptotically negligible relative to Vτ ,
so our confidence intervals have asymptotically nominal coverage.
We bound this term using the expansion µ̂tr (L) = Ntr−1 10Ntr (Ltr,post λ̂post − Ltr,pre λ̂pre ).
